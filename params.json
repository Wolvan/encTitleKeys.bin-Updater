  "body": "#Titlekeys Tools\r\nA tool to easily update the encTitleKeys.bin for [freeShop](https://github.com/Cruel/freeShop) based on [lpp-3ds](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-3ds) or download the `seeddb.bin` and `decTitleKeys.bin`\r\nWhat started out as a fork of MatMaf's encTitleKeys.bin Updater has now been turned into a more all round solution to interact with 3ds.titlekeys.com from your 3ds.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nSimply download the .cia file from the [releases page](/releases) and install it with your favorite .cia Installer, for example FBI. You can also just scan the QR Code from the releases page as well.\r\n\r\nOpen up the App and select `Download latest encTitleKeys.bin`\r\n\r\nYou can also use the .3ds version for a flashcard.\r\n\r\n## Nightlies\r\nNightlies are available at [the official automatic Nightly build page](https://wolvan.github.io/encTitleKeys.bin-Updater/build/) and build whenever changes get pushed to the `master` branch\r\n\r\n##Build instructions\r\nThe building is made possible through a `make` script, meaning you need to have `make` installed and in your path. If you already use devkitArm then you are good to go\r\n\r\nJust run `make` (or `make all`/`make build`) to get your binaries in the build directory\r\n\r\n`build 3ds`, and `build cia` are also available in case not all binaries need to be built.\r\n\r\nYou can also use `make clean` to remove all built files.\r\n\r\n##Credits\r\n\r\n[Cruel](https://github.com/Cruel/) - for making [freeShop](https://github.com/Cruel/freeShop)\r\n\r\n[MatMaf](https://github.com/MatMaf/) - for making the original version of the [Updater](https://github.com/MatMaf/encTitleKeys.bin-Updater)\r\n\r\n[Rinnegatamante](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/) - for making [lpp-3ds](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-3ds)\r\n\r\n[3ds.titlekeys.com](https://3ds.titlekeys.com/) - for collecting all the titlekeys\r\n",
